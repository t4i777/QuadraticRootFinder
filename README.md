# Project No. 1

This is my first GitHub project. I published this project directly from Visual Studio Code.

This project is a quadratic root finder that calculates real or complex roots of a quadratic. I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Please give me some improvements that can be made to this project. Thanks!
